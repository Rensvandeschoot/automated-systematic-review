intro
open-source!
community-driven



ASReview is a proud product of academic collaboration, developed and maintained by the community. Although we do not offer Software as a Service (SaaS) or dedicated customer support typical of commercial software, we are committed to empowering users with comprehensive documentation, responsive issue resolution, and a vibrant community for peer support. For more insights into our open-source vision, visit our blog.
